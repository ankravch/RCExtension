## RCExtension
Simple R Extensions with C language

This is a sample R package to demonstrate how to extent R  functionality by using C language routines. The R supports writing extensions by using a verity of languages. Extension module by using C is very efficient and popular. The R provides flexibility and simplicity for statistical programing, at the same time it is inherently slow. The C language extensions can act as a turbocharger for R modules where it needs speed and efficiency.

### Recommitted system setup to create the package
#### Windows
* [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* [Rtools](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/) (GNU C/C++ compiler is part of it. **FYI**: I may advice it to be installed at default location which is **C:\Rtools**, to avoid extra build setup)
* [LaTeX](https://miktex.org/download) (To create R manuals; a complete build of R including PDF manuals too)
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (Optional: it is convenient to use, but no need of it if you plan to use only command line build.)

#### Linux
TODO: 

### The extension module
The core of the R extension by using C is a shared library (**.so** on Linux and **.DLL** on Windows). This shared library will be loaded on demand into R interpreter's process space by using **dyn.load** and unloaded by **dyn.unload**. 
```C
// Example:
library.dynam("mylib", package, lib.loc)
```
Once the library has loaded into R interpreter's process space, it looks for the symbol named **R_init_mylib**. Similarly, when unloading the object, R looks for a routine named **R_unload_mylib**. Where **'mylib'** is the name of the extension shared library.  
FYI: By default, R uses the operating system-specific dynamic loader to lookup the symbol in the shared library. The recommended approach is explicitly register routines with R and use a single, platform-independent mechanism for finding the routines in shared library.

```C
#include <R.h>
#include <Rinternals.h>
#include <R_ext/Rdynload.h>

void R_init_mylib(DllInfo *info)
{
  // Register routines,
  // allocate resources.
}

void R_unload_mylib(DllInfo *info)
{
  // Release resources.
}
```

### Building the shared library in nutshell
The two main activities involved in building an R package is building the R runtime library and building R manuals.  For building shared library from it C/C++ source code R uses GNU C/C++ compiler.  When you are building it on windows platform you may install Rtools, it contain all necessary utility to complete the build. In short Rtools provides a toolchain for Windows platform that work well with R. It mainly includes GNU make, GNU gcc (from MinGW), and other utilities commonly used on UNIX-ish platform.

##### My Windows Env for R build
```
SET PATH=C:\Dev\R\R-3.4.1\bin\x64;C:\Dev\MiKTeX2.9\miktex\bin\x64\;c:\Rtools\bin;c:\Rtools\mingw_64\bin;%PATH%
```

##### Firing a shared library build
R CMD SHLIB *.c
```bash
C:\work\RCExtension\src>R CMD SHLIB *.c
# The above command that you typed will translate to the following commands.
c:/Rtools/mingw_64/bin/gcc  -I"C:/Dev/R/R-3.4.1/include" -DNDEBUG     -I"d:/Compiler/gcc-4.9.3/local330/include"     -O2 -Wall  -std=gnu99 -mtune=core2 -c MyRCExtn1.c -o MyRCExtn1.o

c:/Rtools/mingw_64/bin/gcc -shared -s -static-libgcc -o MyRCExtn1.dll tmp.def MyRCExtn1.o -Ld:/Compiler/gcc-4.9.3/local330/lib/x64 -Ld:/Compiler/gcc-4.9.3/local330/lib -LC:/Dev/R/R-3.4.1/bin/x64 -lR
```

```bash
C:\work\RCExtension\src>ls -l
total 21

### C Functions
Now we may tell **R interpreter** about the **C functions** that we have packed in the **extension shared library**; eventually these functions will get exposed to R program. We may call (R CAPI)**R_registerRoutines()** function to registering C functions.

R provides a set of interface for extending it, some of them are listed below. In this example we will be using **.Call** interface, it provides nice flexibility and efficiency by giving reference access to memory structures across language boundaries (R vs C). The **.C** interface is relatively simple but not that efficient. Likely endup half the performance compared to **.Call** because it copies objects while exchanging language boundaries.  

```
.C                R_CMethodDef
.Call             R_CallMethodDef
.Fortran          R_FortranMethodDef
.External         R_ExternalMethodDef
```

FYI: If you are planning to writer **C or C++** extension then you may also want to explore the **'Rcpp'** package; though it is not an integral part of R.
